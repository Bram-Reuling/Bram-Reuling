## Who am I?
Hey! My name is Bram Reuling. I am a software engineer with an interest in games, VR and AR. I am passionate about programming tools, games and apps and also about playing and listening to music. My interest in programming started with building, configuring and modding private servers for games like G-Mod and Minecraft for me and my friends to play on. Later I shifted to creating small websites and games in Python, creating apps with Dart, Flutter and Java and some console apps with C#. I am currently studying Creative Media & Game Technologies at Saxion in Enschede as a game engineer.
